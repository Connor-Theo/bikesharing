# bikesharing

### Purpose:
Use data collected from a bike-sharing in New York City and juxtapose it to a successful model in Des Moines Iowa.  The main question from investors: is this a good investment, and will it catch on?  The data collected from over 2 million riders was used to put together various charts to visualize usage rates based on days of the week, by the hour, and filtered by user types (subscribers, one-time customer) and gender.

## Results: 
While we review this data it is important to keep in mind the sheer difference in population density between NYC and Des Moines Iowa.  Des Moines has roughly 2500 people per square mile, New York City has a population density over 10x that amount which makes driving extremely difficult through the city, a higher population density generally means more cars and traffic.  With people needing alternative modes of transportation around the city outside of driving, walking, subway systems, there is a market for bike rental companies. Now, with all of this in mind we can ask ourselves the question of whether this model can be successfully brought over to a city much smaller than New York City.  Below are 7 visualizations showing the data taken from our NYC model:

# Checkout Times for Users: The chart below shows the checkout times by users broken down by hours. the x-axis represents each hour broken down by minutes. The Y-axis depicts the number of bikes tracked in our data. From this we can determine the majority of users checkout after 5 minutes of rental

# Checkout Times by Gender:   Like our first chart 'Checkout Times for Users' the chart below charts the same data, but this time we are breaking it apart by the gender of the user. Of the users who reported their gender, most users using our bike rental are Male. Though we have a noticeable difference in male-female users, the data shows the most frequent ride duration is the same.

# Trips by Weekday per Hour: Using a heat grid we are evaluating 'Trips by Weekday per Hour'. As you may expect, our greatest usage comes from Monday-Friday during rush hour. 8am and 5pm show the darkest regions of the heat grid, our users are more likely to ride to and from work during the week. Saturday and Sunday are more spread out as users have more free time to ride leisurely.

# Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour): Working off the previous heat grid, this time we are breaking our grid up by the reported gender of our users. Per the data we can see that while our male population still dominates the usage count, both men and woman are most often using our bike rental service to commute to work during the week.

# User Trips by Gender by Weekday: With the use of another heat grid we are aiming to locate the distribution of users (male, female, unknown) per weekday that are subscribers to our service, or just users whom decide it is convenient that day as ordinary customers. The data shows that the reported genders are overwhelmingly male and female subscribers, whereas the unknown population holds a greater number of customer user types. this would add up, as the one time use customer may be less likely to fill out their profile accurately.

# Bike Repairs:  Here we can see how durable the bikes are, and how often we can expect repairs to be made. In the most metropolitan locations, we can see the dots get bigger and darker, indicating increased usage, resulting in maintenance being needed. Throughout the city the bikes are consistently handling upwards of 10 uses. The bikes see the most trips near the water on the south side of the city, which would make sense for our weekend riders.

# Top Ending Locations: Our final chart shows us the top ending locations for our bike trips. We consistently see bike trips ending downtown where many folks work, or by the water where we can site-see. This supports our data showing the heavy 8-5pm usage during the work week, people are dropping bikes off close to work downtown.

## Summary:   After reviewing the data, it is my opinion that a bike sharing market does not exist in Des Moines Iowa.  The population would not yield the usage amount that would be needed to make this a profitable model, people are far more likely to drive in Des Moines than ride bikes as the city grid is more spread out. In NYC where the streets are tightly packed with buildings and people, the use of a bike in a major city is feasible and realistic, in Des Moines this is not the case.  A bike sharing application would see less subscribers in Des Moines than in NYC, and this presents a monetary threat as most users in NYC were also subscribers.  While a relaxing bike ride on a sunny day in Des Moines could be fun, this does not mean it is a market that investors should feel safe about.
